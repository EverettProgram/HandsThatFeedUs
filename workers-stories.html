		<h1>Workers’ Stories</h1>
			<p>To better understand the realities of food work, the Food Chain Workers’ Alliance interviewed 20 workers representing each of the five sectors of the food system from 15 FCWA member organizations.</p>
			<p>Every worker described significant challenges for frontline food workers</p>
			<p>They detailed the realities of low wage work, described daily discrimination and abuse, violations of health and safety laws, and the problems that come with temporary employment practices</p>
			<p>They shared stories about the myriad ways in which these conditions prevent them from living a good life—one in which they have a job where they are valued and treated with dignity, they are paid enough to support their family, and they are given enough time off to relax and spend quality time with loved ones</p>
			<p>Collected here are the words of workers from every link in the food chain, spanning experiences of age, gender, race, and citizenship. The results are troubling.</p>

		<h1>Wages</h1>
			<p>Food workers make the lowest wages in the economy. However, wages and the experiences around pay vary by sector and employer.</p>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-01.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>Production workers earn a median hourly wage of $11. Undocumented production workers make even less. Enrique currently earns $9.60 per hour but has worked other jobs where he was paid below the minimum. Catalina worked harvesting oranges at a farm in Florida for over 10 years, making $8.35 per hour.</p>
			<p>Across all five sectors, we heard tales of wage theft, the failure of employers to pay workers what they earned.</p>
			<p>Two of the service workers we spoke to receive the tipped minimum wage and shared stories of low or stolen tips.</p>
			<p>Others detailed not being paid for hours worked.</p>

		<h1>Discrimination &amp; Abuse</h1>
			<p>The problems of low wages and wage theft only partially capture the issues that many food workers face.</p>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-03.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>All of the workers we interviewed cited routine incidents of unfair treatment, including discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, gender, and immigration status.</p>
			<p>Moreover, many of those interviewed had stories of managers treating them with disregard and disrespect.</p>
			<p>The immigrant workers we spoke with, in particular, talked about how discrimination often included threats of deportation to keep them from speaking out about poor conditions and illegal activity, such as not following minimum wage laws or safety regulations.</p>
			<p>Tiofilo and Jorge, two dishwashers in a New York City restaurant confirmed this sentiment, emphasizing that much of the discrimination they face is based on their immigration status.</p>

		<h1>Unstable &amp; Temporary Work</h1>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-05.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>The entire food industry, like all sectors of the economy, is increasingly structured so that companies have "hyper-flexibility" across all areas of their work.</p>
			<p>Rather than hire workers as permanent employees, companies instead hire workers through contractors, temp agencies, and staffing agencies.</p>
			<p>These strategies allow companies to avoid paying higher wages and to evade legal responsibility for providing health insurance and other work benefits to the employees.</p>
			<p>While this flexibility might help companies save money, the effects on workers include lower pay, unpredictable schedules and hours, fewer benefits, little job security, and very few opportunities for advancement.</p>
			<p>This dependence on cheap, contingent workers effectively creates a low-wage marginalized workforce that can find no possibility of career advancement. Across interviews, we heard stories about how these trends hurt workers.</p>

		<h1>Unpredictable Schedules &amp; Difficult Hours</h1>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-07.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>Unpredictable scheduling with too few hours or long shifts with no flexibility to cut hours left the workers we interviewed feeling that they lack agency and control over their lives.</p>
			<p>About half of the workers we interviewed told us about their schedules being kept just below full-time in order for companies to avoid offering them benefits.</p>
			<p>The other half talked about needing to work so many hours that they had no time for anything else.</p>
			<p>In addition to not getting enough hours, workers with erratic schedules have trouble keeping a second job because they can’t predict when they will be available.</p>
			<p>This is a problem because they are often not making quite enough to get by and become trapped in a cycle of poverty.</p>

		<h1>Personal Health and Sickness</h1>
			<p>While many of the workers we interviewed told us about getting sick more often because of their jobs, they don’t have any support from the same jobs to ensure that they can take time off to take care of themselves and stay healthy.</p>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-09.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>Or, even when they do take time off, they are punished for absences with larger workloads, so many report not adequately taking care of their health needs in order to avoid additional stress at work.</p>
			<p>Some workers have paid sick days after organizing efforts or recent legislation; others, who are employed informally, do not.</p>
			<p>Because pay is tied to the hours worked, many workers opt to work while sick, even if it is additionally unsafe while handling food.</p>
			<p>In addition, many workers don’t have health insurance and can’t get the quality care they need when they are sick.</p>

		<h1>Organizing</h1>
			<p>The interviews show that across the board food workers face a variety of serious challenges.</p>
			<p><img src="assets/workers/workers-11.jpg" class="cen-full-width" /></p>
			<p>All the interviewees shared one quality in common—they are all members of organizations that are fighting for better conditions, wages, and treatment at their jobs.</p>
			<p>For example, Steven organizes with the Warehouse Worker Resource Center (WWRC) on its long-term campaign to fight for basic rights for the workers at Cal Cartage warehouse company.</p>
			<p>He listed the many wins he’s seen while at the warehouse, attributing them to the work of WWRC: more health and safety measures followed; compliance with the requirement that workers are paid for their time at the warehouse if they are called in, even when there is no work; tougher oversight on paychecks to address wage theft issues.</p>
